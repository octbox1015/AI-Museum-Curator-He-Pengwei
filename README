# AI Museum Curator — Greek Mythology Edition

Interactive Streamlit app that fetches artwork metadata from The Metropolitan Museum of Art and uses (optional) OpenAI models to generate curator-style explanations, plus visualizations.

## Features
- Browse Greek deities and fetch related MET artworks (only displays artworks with downloadable images).  
- Works & Analysis: left–right layout (large image + structured information).  
- Interactive Art Zone: visual-detail Q&A, sketch analysis, myth identifier, Jungian-style archetype mapping, image generation (requires OpenAI).  
- Mythology Network: interactive relationship graph (PyVis).  
- Artwork Timeline: scatter + histogram of artwork begin dates (Plotly).  
- About section: each artwork page shows metadata and an "About this artwork page" note.  
- Data source: MET Museum Open API.

## Quick start
1. `pip install -r requirements.txt`  
2. `streamlit run app.py`  
3. On Home tab paste your OpenAI API Key (session-only) to enable AI features.

## Local course PDF (development reference)
The app references the local course PDF used in development at:
`/mnt/data/LN_-_Art_and_Advanced_Big_Data_-_W12_-_Designing_%26_Implementing_with_AI (1).pdf`

## Notes
- Fetching many MET records can take time; adjust sliders to control the number.  
- AI features require a valid OpenAI key and may consume credits.  
- If the network graph fails in some environments, the app will show an error message but continue to function.
