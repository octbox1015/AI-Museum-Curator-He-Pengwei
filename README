# Mythic Art Explorer
A Streamlit-based interactive digital museum that connects Greek mythology with real artworks from The Metropolitan Museum of Art (MET). The app integrates MET Open Access API data, AI-generated curatorial analysis, and multiple visualization tools.

---

## Overview

Mythic Art Explorer allows users to explore Greek gods, heroes, mythological creatures, and artistic representations. It combines three components:

1. Real museum data  
2. Big-data visualization  
3. AI-driven art interpretation and personality analysis  

The result is a modern, research-friendly, visually compelling digital humanities tool.
