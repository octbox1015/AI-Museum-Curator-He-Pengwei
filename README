- Added Myth Archetype Matcher (Jungian-style quiz).

## MET slide PDF (reference)
The app links to a course PDF at:  
`/mnt/data/LN_-_Art_and_Advanced_Big_Data_-_W12_-_Designing_%26_Implementing_with_AI (1).pdf`  
(If deploying publicly, include the PDF in repo or host it publicly and update the link.)

## Requirements
See `requirements.txt`.

## Notes
- AI features require a valid OpenAI API Key with chat & image access.  
- Image generation consumes credits — test conservatively.
