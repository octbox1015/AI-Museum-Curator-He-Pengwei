# 🏛️ AI Museum Curator — Greek Mythology Edition

Interactive Streamlit app connecting MET Museum data with OpenAI to produce curator-level artwork analyses and interactive experiences.

## What’s special in this version
- Greek Deities: fetch all relevant MET works that **actually have accessible images** (no fake images). You can increase `Max results` slider up to 200 to try more records.
- Works & Analysis: **left–right layout** (left large image ~600px, right structured metadata & AI content). When a work is selected, gallery hides (focus view). Click **Back to Gallery** to return.
- Robust image fallback: primaryImageSmall → primaryImage → additionalImages.
- Interactive Art Zone: detail Q&A, sketch style hints, myth ID, Jungian Myth Archetype Matcher, image generation.

## Quick start
1. `pip install -r requirements.txt`  
2. `streamlit run app.py`  
3. On Home page paste your OpenAI API Key (session-only) or set `OPENAI_API_KEY` in environment/Secrets.
4. Go to **Greek Deities** → choose figure → Fetch related works → select thumbnail → view detail in **Works & Analysis**.
