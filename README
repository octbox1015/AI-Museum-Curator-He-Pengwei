# AI Museum Curator — Greek Mythology Edition

An interactive Streamlit app that fetches real artwork metadata from The Metropolitan Museum of Art (MET) and (optionally) uses OpenAI to generate curator-style explanations. The app focuses on Greek mythology: gods, titans, heroes, and mythic creatures.
